# utilities

C++ header-only utility library which I use in every project. All headers are placed in `/include/utils` directory.

 * `types.h` - aliases for primitive types
 * `bits.h` - utils to work with binary values
 * `geometry.h` - geometry primitives and aliases
 * `collections.h` - aliases for C++ collections
 * `unix.h` - wrappers around UNIX system calls
 * `qtree.h` - quad tree implementation
